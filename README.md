# Conveyor

Conveyor is a comprehensive UI library for quickly building UI components to interact with GraphQL APIs generated by the [Magql](https://github.com/autoinvent/magql) library. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your GraphQL data.

## Usage

First, install the library:

```bash
pnpm install @autoinvent/conveyor
```

Then you can use it in your project.


## Scripts

- `pnpm preview` - locally preview the production build.
- `pnpm test` - run tests in watch mode.
- `pnpm test:ci` - run tests once without watch mode.
- `pnpm test:ui` - run tests with ui.
